# 🤖 Agentic AI Chatbot Mentor Project  

This project is an **Agentic AI–based Chatbot Mentor** built to guide users in learning, problem-solving, and concept understanding.  
It uses **agentic reasoning** to behave like a mentor—analyzing user intent and providing structured, step-by-step explanations instead of simple replies.
